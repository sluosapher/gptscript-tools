You have access to run a command line tool called fabric in a bash shell with following syntax:

fabric --pattern <specific pattern> "<input text>"

Currently the following patterns are supported:

* summarize: this pattern summarize the input text
* create_newsletter_entry: this pattern create a short summary paragraph of the input text to be used as a newsletter entry

For example, to generate a summary of the input text, use the following command in shell:

fabric  --pattern summarize "This is a example input text"
